       <h2>Demo Applet</h2>
      <p>
       This is a demo applet that shows a dynamic chart along with all recent 
       UI controls available. It prints summations of 
       random values [positive or negative] on the y axis and a timestamp on the x axis. 
       The y-axis has been forced to always show the range between -20 and +20. 
      </p>
      <p> 
       A message about an invalid digital signature will pop up. The applet uses a filechooser to 
       allow you saving a snapshot image to a location on your harddisk of your choice. 
       So the applet had to be signed. Please understand that I cannot to afford to pay a 
       CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY ("Trusted Third Party") organization to verify the signature. 
      </p>
      <p>
       The amount of points as well as the period in which a new point is added may be 
       chosen. The sliders allow values that should cause a high cpu load or weird labeling. 
       This is intended and allows to experiment with the effect of configuration and to 
       find good settings. The sourcecode may be viewed through the 
       <a target="_blank" href="http://jchart2d.cvs.sourceforge.net/jchart2d/jchart2d/src/info/monitorenter/gui/chart/demos/Showcase.java?view=markup">cvs web-access</a>
