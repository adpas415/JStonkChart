jchart2d-2.1.2 - July, 25th, 2007

* Fixed issue #1711148: LayoutFactory does not provide documented methods. 
! Configurable context menu entry for zooming out for ChartPanel when wrapping 
  a ZoomableChart. Contribution by Vasilis Pappas. 
! Only use lower unit in LabelFormatterAutoUnits when data range is 
  smaller 1.5 of a whole unit. 
! New error bar policy for summation of absolute values. 
! Added default constructors and additional setters for bean compliance 
  of label formatters.   
* Fixed issue with UI not reacting upon changed label formatter of Axis at runtime.
* Fixed issue with UI not reacting upon changed number format of 
  LabelFormatterNumber at runtime.
* Fixed issue with concurrent painting / potential deadlock in addErrorBarPolicy 
  and setErrorBarPolicy of traces. 
* Fixes issue with traces not updating in case the error bar policies / their 
  configuration changes at runtime.

  corresponding error bar segment is changed at runtime.

* Fixed issue with axis scale values that appear out of the chart area (too low).
* Fixed issue with traces being rescaled in both dimensions even if only one 
  dimension changed (Performance improvement). 
! Updated profiling support to Java Interactive Profiler (JIP) Version 1.1(final).
! Major performance improvement for updateScaling: JProfiler measured ~42 % total of paint 
  runtime before, now takes ~ 16 %.
! New info.monitorenter.gui.chart.labelformatters.LabelFormatterUnit allows to specify 
  a fixed unit for an axis. 
  
jchart2d-2.1.1 - March, 30st, 2007

* Fixed issue #1586616: Removing trace from chart dos not delete label in ChartPanel.
! New UI action for setting physical units for traces in ChartPanel. 
! New UI action for removing trace in ChartPanel (disabled by default, enable by 
  LayoutFactory.getInstance().setShowRemoveTraceMenu(true)). 
* Fixed issue #1601947: image export with snaphot() when chart is not visible (not sized).
! New method IErrorBarPolicy.removeErrorBarPainter(IErrorBarPainter). 
! Improved property change handling for IErrorBarPolicy implementations 
  along with reusable Action implementations. 
* Fixed issue #1644055: Bounds check in ATrace2D doesn't catch removed extremum.

jchart2d-2.1.0 - October, 12th, 2006

o Renamed 
  info.monitorenter.gui.chart.controls.LayoutFactory.createContextMenuLable(Chart2D, ITrace2D, boolean) 
  to 
  info.monitorenter.gui.chart.controls.LayoutFactory.createContextMenuLabel(Chart2D, ITrace2D, boolean) 
o Renamed 
  info.monitorenter.chart.ITrace2D.getLable() 
  to 
  info.monitorenter.chart.ITrace2D.getLabel() 
o Renamed 
  info.monitorenter.chart.axis.AAxis.getMinimumValueDistanceForLables() 
  to 
  info.monitorenter.chart.axis.AAxis.getMinimumValueDistanceForLabels()
o Renamed 
  info.monitorenter.chart.axis.AAxis.getMaximumPixelForLable() 
  to 
  info.monitorenter.chart.axis.AAxis.getMaximumPixelForLabel()
* Chartpanel does not claim the correct height for an amount 
  of trace labels (below chart) that exceeds available width.
* Bugfix #1573885:  Range dialog has misspelled "Chancel" button.
* Fixed obfuscated method names in ILabelFormatter of previous binary release.
* Recalculate bound in case a trace gets visible or invisible 
  at runtime to zoom to the optimal bounds upon visibility changes. 
- Redesigned re- / transformation from px values to chart data 
  values.
o Moved AAxis from package info.monitorenter.gui.chart to 
  package info.monitorenter.gui.chart.axis.
* Repaint chart in static mode if trace is set visible / invible 
  to reflect that change (discovered by Anton Kratz).
! ZoomableChart supports zooming in both directions 
  (contribution by Klaus Pesendorfer, Fabalabs). 
! First error bar policy implementation: 
  info.monitorenter.gui.chart.errorbars.ErrorBarPolicyRelative. 
  See info.monitorenter.gui.chart.demos.StaticChartErrorBarLineDisc 
  for a demonstration of the error bar API. 
! Highly configurable error bar API supported in core (vs.: UI): 
  Choose the direction (x/y,positive/negative), 
  kind of error bar policy and the way of rendering 
  (end point -, start point - and segment - painter). 
- Separated code for painting a point from code to manage painting a whole trace 
  and reused this for error bar rendering: 
  Factored out duplications, increased modularization and maintainability. 
o Refactored 
  info.monitorenter.gui.chart.ITracePainter.discontinue()
  to
  info.monitorenter.gui.chart.ITracePainter.discontinue(java.awt.Graphics2D)

! New trace painter for vertical filled bars: info.monitorenter.gui.chart.traces.painters.TracePainterVerticalBar
* Bugfix #1523799: LabelFormatter property overwritten for new AAxis.
- Refactored axis actions to always be based on the current chart (stability, consistancy). 
! LayoutFactory supports the option for standard menus 
  (vs. UI-property adapting menus [foreground color, background color,...].
- Modularized the creation of trace menus in LayoutFactory. 
! Configurable visibility of menu entries for Popup and Menubar menus. 
o Moved info.monitorenter.gui.chart.layout.LayoutFactory to 
  info.monitorenter.gui.chart.controls.LayoutFactory.
o Moved info.monitorenter.gui.chart.layout.ChartPanel to 
  info.monitorenter.gui.chart.views.ChartPanel.
o Moved info.monitorenter.gui.chart.layout.demos.CoordinateViewChart to 
  info.monitorenter.gui.chart.demos.CoordinateViewChart.
o Renamed package info.monitorenter.gui.chart.layout.controls to 
  info.monitorenter.gui.chart.controls.

jchart2d-2.0.1 - June, 5th, 2006

- Binaries are now compiled with 1.4 option against java 1.5.0_07-b03.
* Catch exceptions caused by illegal data for axis implementations 
  that transform values - Return 0 and only output a warning 
  (innapropriate axis implementation for this data) every 30 seconds.
! Menu item for saving chart image to file. 
* JMenus that are submenus did not use background color. 
  (http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=5097866).
* Trace labels in ChartPanel did not adapt text and color of corresponding 
  trace.
* All menu items linked to axis would not function any more after setting 
  a new axis to the chart. 
* Don't loose state information and overtake listeners when setting 
  a new axis to a chart. This bug showed strange behaviour in UI 
  after a new axis type had been set: E.g. grid was not painted 
  any more. 
* Scale value to 0 and print a warning on the console if 
  a logarithmic axis is used and a value is < 1. 
  (Instead of letting an exception go to the awt paint thread).
  
jchart2d-2.0.0 - May, 31th, 2006

! Added profiling support in build.xml with Java Interactive 
  Profiler (JIP).
* Started to use a new sourceforge package for each new version 
  on sourceforge (bugreport by Ken Webb).
! Optional use of standard UI menu items for menubar and popup menu 
  (instead of thos that adapt their UI to the chart). 
! New menu bar available in LayoutFactory 
  (see info.monitorenter.chart.layout.ChartPanel). 
* Change of grid color of chart would not fire the expected event. 
* Ignore color choice if dialog for choosing color is cancelled. 
! Smaller distributed jar file by shrinking to the needed classes 
  (exclusion of unused classes in 3rd party jars).
* Update context menu label states (for radio button or checkbox menu items) 
  if chart configuration changes from other sources than the menu itself. 
* Repaint upon change of grid color in static mode 
  (no points are added).
* Don't unselect checkbox menu item for trace painter if removal failed 
  due to "at least leave one painter" strategy. 
* Repaint upon change of color of a trace in static mode 
  (no points are added).
* Repaint upon change of painter of a trace in static mode 
  (no points are added).
* Repaint upon change of stroke of a trace in static mode 
  (no points are added).
! Initial support for zooming in x dimension by mouse gestures in 
  info.monitorenter.gui.chart.ZoomabelChart, contribution by Alessio Sambarino.

  (Contribution by Klaus Pesendorfer, fabasoft).
