History of changes for the jchart2d project.

Changes are chronologically ordered from top (most recent) 
to bottom (least recent).

Legend:
! New Feature
* Bug fixed, (unreleased) points out that this bug was never released. 
- General comment
o API change that requires refactoring. 
  Note that refactoring of protected code intended for library 
  internal details will not be listed.

jchart2d-2.2.3 - May, 30st, 2008

* Fixed bug #1878068: RangePolicyHighestValuesForcedMin is not in released jar. 
* Fixed bug #1930893: ZoomableChart now interpolates the connections of two 
  invisible points if their connection crosses the zooming window. 
* Fixed bug #1941871: Size of image is not correct when taking snapshot.
* Fixed issue with ClassCastException in ErrorBarPolicyMultiAction when using java 1.6.
* Fixed concurrent issue if all points of traces are removed and added (same values) 
  in-between two painting - cycles (wrong saling -> rendering). 
* Fixed issue with limitation of 1000 points per trace in default mode 
  (TracePainterPolyline used). 
- Code style cleanup. 
- Improved performance for charts without error bars. 

jchart2d-2.2.2 - December, 13th, 2007

* Fixed serious error reported by Robin Weisberg: Maximum Y value change was 
  not detected causing an inifinte loop (100 % cpu usage) or an invalid scaling. 
* Don't incorporate empty traces in extremum search.
* Fixed bug #1821361: Output of ATrace2D.setName() subject to race condition?
! A minimum repaint latency may be configured that allows to collapse many 
  repaint requests into one (required for high performance in real time applications).
o Extended method 
  public void paintPoint(final int absoluteX, final int absoluteY, final int nextX,
      final int nextY, final Graphics2D g);
  in class 
  info.monitorenter.gui.chart.IPointPainter 
  to 
  public void paintPoint(final int absoluteX, final int absoluteY, final int nextX,
      final int nextY, final Graphics2D g, final TracePoint2D original);
  to provide more information to the point painters. 

jchart2d-2.2.1 - October, 22nd, 2007

* Fixed bug that prevented repainting when points are added / changed 
  that do not change bounds and no UI interaction has taken place. 
* Fixed unreported bug with error bars exceeding drawing area in zoomed mode 
  of ZoomableChart.   
* Fixed bug related to zooming with ZoomableChart that uses at least one 
  AxisTransformation subtype (reported and fixed by Andrea Plotegher). 
* Fixed performance bug: Each error bar was painted / calculated twice per frame. 
* Fixed bug with wrong errorbars when using AAxisTransformation subclasses as axis. 
  This was a serious rounding issue and is fixed by a redesign: Transformation of 
  pixel to value and to pixel again for error bars was dropped, so performance 
  has increased too. 
* Fixed bug #1814786: Lowering maximum via TracePoint2D.setLocation fails 
  by contribution of Gerald Struck (tankex). 
* Fixed unreported bug with modal dialogs dropping behind if main window 
  is minimized and then maximized again. 
* Fixed bug #1941871: Size of image is not correct when taking snapshot. 
! Removed internal Painter Thread for faster UI updates and increased stability. 
! Switched to proguard version 4.0: Binary distribution is a bit smaller. 
! Added test case for bug report #1803342: Deadlock into Chard2D.paint: Succeeds. 
! Started to use findbugs. 
! New UI action for setting titles of axis. 
! New UI action for setting title fonts of axis. 
- Improved performance for charts without error bars.

  for support of traces that compute their values based upon other 
  traces (e.g. average).
! Added info.monitorenter.gui.chart.traces.computing.Trace2DArithmeticMean 
  that displays the arithemtic mean of the last n (contrcutor - given) 
  added data points. See 
  info.monitorenter.gui.chart.demosDynamicChartWithArithmeticMeanTrace 
  for a demo. 
! Support for stacking charts vertically with same x coordinate start 
  via Chart2D.setSynchronizedXStartChart(Chart2D) 
  (contribution by Karl Piteira). 
! Support for axis titles via IAxis.setTitlePainer(IAxisTitlePainter) 
  and IAxis.setTitle(String). 
! New AxisInverse allows to display values in descending order (10, 9, 8, ...0). 
  Contribution by Andrea Plotegher while working on IR spectroscopy. 
! Extended info.monitorenter.gui.chart.errorbars.ErrorBarPolicyRelative by 
  allowing to configure relative x and y errors (vs. only one relative error 
  for alll dimensions). 
! Finished integration of error bar wizard into GUI controls of ChartPanel. 
* Fixed issue  #1769652: zoom all menu item doesn't repaint the chart when selected. 
* Fixed unreported deadlock when using ChartPanel with multiple traces. 
* Fixed unreleased issue that painted a connection from the last point of 
  a trace to the first point of the next trace (multiple traces), reported 
  by Andrea Plotegher. 
* Fixed bug with chart bounds upon decreasing error bar expansion. 
* Fixed bug with non - UI property adapting strokes menu in LayoutFactory 
  (fixed by Andrea Plotegher).
* Fixed bug #1790622: using trace.setLocation(..) fails. Now changed points will 
  be reflected in the UI without exception and correct display. 
* Fixed unreported issue with incorrect repaint if partial repaint is triggered by another 
  Thread than the painter (e.g. if a modal dialog is closed). 
* Fixed unreported display issue with LabelFormatterNumber using a format that 
  enforces digits (e.g.:  new DecimalFormat("000.000");) and overwrites the y axis. 
- Changed internal API of traces for supporting chains of computational traces.
- Moved logic for finding chart bounds to axis classes. 
o Renamed net.monitorenter.gui.chart.ILabelFormatter to 
  net.monitorenter.gui.chart.IAxisLabelFormatter.

jchart2d-2.0.1 - June, 5th, 2006

* Catch exceptions caused by illegal data for axis implementations 
  that transform values - Return 0 and only output a warning 
  (innapropriate axis implementation for this data) every 30 seconds.
! Menu item for saving chart image to file. 
* JMenus that are submenus did not use background color. 
  (http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=5097866).
* Trace labels in ChartPanel did not adapt text and color of corresponding 
  trace.
* All menu items linked to axis would not function any more after setting 
  a new axis to the chart. 
* Don't loose state information and overtake listeners when setting 
  a new axis to a chart. This bug showed strange behaviour in UI 
  after a new axis type had been set: E.g. grid was not painted 
  any more. 
* Scale value to 0 and print a warning on the console if 
  a logarithmic axis is used and a value is < 1. 
  (Instead of letting an exception go to the awt paint thread).
- Binaries are now compiled with 1.4 option against java 1.5.0_07-b03.
  
jchart2d-2.0.0 - May, 31th, 2006

* Started to use a new sourceforge package for each new version 
  on sourceforge (bugreport by Ken Webb).

* Ignore color choice if dialog for choosing color is cancelled. 
* Update context menu label states (for radio button or checkbox menu items) 
  if chart configuration changes from other sources than the menu itself. 
* Repaint upon change of grid color in static mode 
  (no points are added).
* Don't unselect checkbox menu item for trace painter if removal failed 
  due to "at least leave one painter" strategy. 
* Repaint upon change of color of a trace in static mode 
  (no points are added).
* Repaint upon change of painter of a trace in static mode 
  (no points are added).
* Repaint upon change of stroke of a trace in static mode 
  (no points are added).
* Bugfix: Wrong space for the chart on right edge as wrong label length 
  (of y labels) was used for calculation.
* Bugfix: RingBuffer lost last element if buffer size was increased. 
* Bugfix for unreleased version (29.04.06): 
  Wrong minY search routine in traces.
* Bugfix: setting new range with only one bound changed to rangepolicy 
  would not cause rescaling. 
* Changing paint grid state would not cause a full repaint thus leaving unpainted grid in space 
  when nothing changes in the traces of the chart. 
* Grid paint selection in context menu of ChartPanel was 
  not initalized to checked state correctly. 
* TracePainter selection in context menu of ChartPanel was 
  not initialized to checked state correctly. 
* No more repaint if no update has happened to the chart data model.

  info.monitorenter.gui.chart.ZoomabelChart, contribution by Alessio Sambarino.
! Don't use bounds of invisible traces 
  (Contribution by Klaus Pesendorfer, fabasoft).

  color is set to current foreground color or foreground color 
  is set to current background color by switching them.
