o API change that requires refactoring.

jchart2d-2.0.0 - May, 31th, 2006

* Started to use a new package for each new version on sourceforge 
  (bugreport by Ken Webb).
! Optional use of standard UI menu items for menubar and popup menu 
  (instead of thos that adapt their UI to the chart). 
! New menu bar available in LayoutFactory 
  (see info.monitorenter.chart.layout.ChartPanel). 
* Change of grid color of chart would not fire the expected event. 
* Ignore color choice if dialog for choosing color is cancelled. 
! Smaller distributed jar file by shrinking to the needed classes 
  (exclusion of unused classes in 3rd party jars).
* Update context menu label states (for radio button or checkbox menu items) 
  if chart configuration changes from other sources than the menu itself. 
* Repaint upon change of grid color in static mode 
  (no points are added).
* Don't unselect checkbox menu item for trace painter if removal failed 
  due to "at least leave one painter" strategy. 
* Repaint upon change of color of a trace in static mode 
  (no points are added).
* Repaint upon change of painter of a trace in static mode 
  (no points are added).
* Repaint upon change of stroke of a trace in static mode 
  (no points are added).
! Initial support for zooming in x dimension by mouse gestures in 
  info.monitorenter.gui.chart.ZoomabelChart, contribution by Alessio Sambarino.
! Don't use bounds of invisible traces 
  (Contribution by Klaus Pesendorfer, fabasoft).

  info.monitorenter.gui.chart.traces.

  info.monitorenter.gui.chart.axis.
o Removed  public final double getScaledValueY(double). 
  Use Chart2D.getAxisY().getScaledValue(double).
o Removed  public final double getScaledValueX(double). 
  Use Chart2D.getAxisX().getScaledValue(double).
o Removed public final double Chart2D.getOffsetY().

o Moved IRangePolicy implementations to subpackage 
  info.monitorenter.gui.chart.rangepolies.
o Moved ILabelFormatter implementations to subpackage 
  info.monitorenter.gui.chart.labelformatters.
* Bugfix: Wrong space for the chart on right edge as wrong label length 
  (of y labels) was used for calculation.
o Removed AAxis.getUnit(). Use AAxis.getFormatter().getUnit(). 
o Changed package structure from "aw." to "info.monitorenter.".
! Ensure that context menu remains readable if background 
  color is set to current foreground color or foreground color 
  is set to current background color by switching them. 
o Renamed all interfaces with prefix I.
o Renamed all abstract classes with prefix A.
! Added tool tip text to context menu for range policy of axis. 
* Bugfix: RingBuffer lost last element if buffer size was increased. 
* Bugfix for unreleased version (29.04.06): 
  Wrong minY search routine in traces.
! Added RangePolicyMinimumViewport to context menu of ChartPanel.
! Axis type (linear, log e, log 10) selectable from popup menu 
  of ChartPanel.
* Bugfix: setting new range with only one bound changed to rangepolicy 
  would not cause rescaling. 
o Chart2D.setScaleX(final boolean show) has been removed. 
  Use Chart2D.getAxisX().setPaintGrid(final boolean grid) instead.
o Chart2D.getScaleX() has been removed. 
  Use Chart2D.getAxisX().isPaintGrid() instead.
o Chart2D.setScaleY(final boolean show) has been removed.

  Use Chart2D.getAxisY().isPaintScale() instead.
o Chart2D.setGridX() has been removed. 
  Use Chart2D.getAxisX().setPaintScale(final boolean show) instead.
o Chart2D.getGridX() has been removed. 
  Use Chart2D.getAxisX().isPaintScale() instead.

  Use LabelFormatters instead.
o Chart2D.setDecimalsY(final int decimals) has been removed. 
  Use LabelFormatters instead.
o Axis.setFractionsDigits(int) has been removed. 
  Use LabelFormatters instead.
! Experimental version for logarithmic axis (base 10 and e), 
  initial contribution by Pieter-Jan Busschaert. 
* Changing paint grid state would not cause a full repaint thus leaving unpainted grid in space 
  when nothing changes in the traces of the chart. 
* Grid paint selection in context menu of ChartPanel was 
  not initalized to checked state correctly. 
* TracePainter selection in context menu of ChartPanel was 
  not initialized to checked state correctly. 
! Added tooltip for displaying chart value coordinates 
  along with methods to turn on and off (default: on).
! Added panel for display of chart coordinates 
  triggered by mouse motion.
! Translation from mouse events to chart coordinates in chart. 
* No more repaint if no update has happened to the chart data model.

jchart2d-1.1.0 - February 12, 2006

! New viewports: zoomed, maximum values only, ... .
! Linear interpolation towards bounds for zoomed viewports.
! Number formatted labels.
! Restarting of data collectors after stop.
! Clear traces.
! Date formatted labels.
! Rendering with strokes for traces
  (dashed, dotted, thick,...).
! Z-index property for traces.
! Traces may be set invisible.
- Refactored core sourcecode conforming to checkstyle
  configuration.
* new Thread(anAbstractDataCollector).start() is permitted,
  anAbstractDataCollector.start() has to be used.
! Tracepainter for discs.
! Tracepainter for filled polygons.
! Tracepainter that uses polyline.
* Use JComponent foreground color (setForeground(Color))
  for Axis and scale labels.
! Support for fixed viewports (zooming).
! Rounding for scale labels to minor and major ticks.
! More controls in popups of ChartPanel: foreground color.
- Warning all action classes in info.monitorenter.gui.chart.event
  have been renamed.
  Those were never released in previous versions but
  available in cvs.
! Refactored interface for IRangepolicy to allow viewports
  that react upon the range of the chart.

1.03:
 - New feature that allows saving the Chart2D to an image.
 - New feature that allows to stop data collection.
 ! New Showcase application that demonstrates the new
   feature.  Invoke with:
   java -cp jchart2d-1.03.jar info.monitorenter.gui.chart.demo.Showcase
 ! Improved build for source release.

1.02:
 * Deadlock when explicitly invoking Chart2D.paint(..)
   [BTW no swing/awt program should do this]. Dropped
   unneccessary monitor.

1.01:
 * A major bug in the Trace2DSimple implementation,
   that caused a scaling error.
 * Weird "line from last point to (0,0)" - bug.
 ! Complete new synchronization design:
   Client Threads (your code) is now not involved in
   scaling operations any more.
