jchart2d-1.1.0 - February 12, 2006

! New viewports: zoomed, maximum values only, ... .
! Linear interpolation towards bounds for zoomed viewports.
! Number formatted labels.
! Restarting of data collectors after stop.
! Clear traces.
! Date formatted labels.
! Rendering with strokes for traces
  (dashed, dotted, thick,...).
! Z-index property for traces.
! Traces may be set invisible.
- Refactored core sourcecode conforming to checkstyle
  configuration.
* new Thread(anAbstractDataCollector).start() is permitted,
  anAbstractDataCollector.start() has to be used.
! Tracepainter for discs.
! Tracepainter for filled polygons.
! Tracepainter that uses polyline.
* Use JComponent foreground color (setForeground(Color))
  for Axis and scale labels.
! Support for fixed viewports (zooming).
! Rounding for scale labels to minor and major ticks.
! More controls in popups of ChartPanel: foreground color.
- Warning all action classes in aw.gui.chart.event
  have been renamed.
  Those were never released in previous versions but
  available in cvs.
! Refactored interface for IRangepolicy to allow viewports
  that react upon the range of the chart.

1.03:
 - New feature that allows saving the Chart2D to an image.
 - New feature that allows to stop data collection.
 ! New Showcase application that demonstrates the new
   feature.  Invoke with:
   java -cp jchart2d-1.03.jar aw.gui.chart.demo.Showcase
 ! Improved build for source release.

1.02:
 * Deadlock when explicitly invoking Chart2D.paint(..)
   [BTW no swing/awt program should do this]. Dropped
   unneccessary monitor.

1.01:
 * A major bug in the Trace2DSimple implementation,
   that caused a scaling error.
 * Weird "line from last point to (0,0)" - bug.
 ! Complete new synchronization design:
   Client Threads (your code) is now not involved in
   scaling operations any more.
